# math-app
React app being used by my 7 year old son in his math drills.  Starting with addition we'll add more operations and more options for higher numbers - as his studies and skill level increase, so will my skills as a developer!

 ## Install
 
 After cloning the repo (git clone https://github.com/songandchance/math-app.git):

 ```sh
cd my-app
npm install
npm start
```

 Then open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to see the app.<br>

 ## Step-by-Step

 No configuration or complicated folder structures, just the files you need to run the app.<br>
Once the cloning process is done, you can open your project folder:

 ```sh
cd post-app
```

 Inside the newly created project, you can run some built-in commands:

 ### `npm install` and `npm start`

 Runs the app in development mode.<br>
